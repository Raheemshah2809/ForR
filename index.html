                        <p>
                            I thought instead of a card, heres something you can keep with you all the time. 
                        </p>

                            Well, I'm glad to have met you, from the late night calls and league games to just straight up texting, I enjoyed every minute of it. Alhumdulilah you're one the most supportive, bright, funny, caring person I've ever met. And no matter how tough life gets to you I'll always be there for you, and I'll always do Dua for you. So Don't ever be upset that I'm not here I'm not and never will be upset with you. How can I get upset at a roadman.
